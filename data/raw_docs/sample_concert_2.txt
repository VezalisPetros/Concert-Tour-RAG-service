The Arctic Monkeys will kick off their 2026 tour in Los Angeles in February, followed by shows in Toronto, Chicago, and Berlin. The tour features an acoustic set for the first time and special guest performances by Florence Welch in Europe.

The stage design is inspired by retro-futuristic aesthetics. Logistics include new lighting rigs and eco-friendly tour buses. Final shows will be held in Barcelona and Lisbon in late April 2026.
